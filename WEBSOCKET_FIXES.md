# WebSocket Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Improved Socket Service (`app/lib/socket.ts`)**
- ✅ Added better error handling and connection monitoring
- ✅ Implemented `safeEmit()` method to prevent errors when socket is disconnected
- ✅ Added automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging connection issues
- ✅ Added graceful handling when socket server is not available

### 2. **Updated Services to Use Safe Socket Emission**
- ✅ `app/lib/api/services/reservation.service.ts` - All socket.emit() calls now use SocketService.safeEmit()
- ✅ `app/lib/api/services/menu.service.ts` - All socket.emit() calls now use SocketService.safeEmit()
- ✅ Removed redundant socket connection checks since safeEmit() handles this internally

### 3. **Enhanced Hooks for Better Error Handling**
- ✅ `app/hooks/useRealtimeReservations.ts` - Added connection status monitoring
- ✅ `app/hooks/useRealtimeBookings.ts` - Added connection status monitoring
- ✅ Both hooks now gracefully handle when socket server is unavailable
- ✅ Added fallback to demo data in development mode

### 4. **New Components for WebSocket Management**
- ✅ `app/components/WebSocketErrorBoundary.tsx` - Catches WebSocket-related errors
- ✅ `app/components/WebSocketStatus.tsx` - Shows real-time connection status
- ✅ Added WebSocket status indicator to VendorHeader

### 5. **Configuration and Documentation**
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with WebSocket configuration guidance
- ✅ Added environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` for flexible socket server configuration
- ✅ Added development vs production behavior differences

## How This Fixes WebSocket Errors

### Before:
- Socket connection failures caused uncaught errors
- App would break if socket server was unavailable
- No user feedback about connection status
- Hard-coded socket URLs

### After:
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: App works perfectly even without socket server
- ✅ **Error Handling**: All socket errors are caught and handled gracefully
- ✅ **User Feedback**: WebSocket status indicator shows connection state
- ✅ **Development Friendly**: Clear error messages and demo data in development
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and user notifications in production
- ✅ **Configurable**: Socket server URL can be configured via environment variables

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Set this to enable real-time features
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Development Mode
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` is not set, real-time features are disabled
- App shows demo data instead of failing
- Clear console messages explain what's happening

### Production Mode
- Real-time features fail gracefully if socket server is unavailable
- Users see appropriate error messages
- App functionality remains intact

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Without Socket Server**: App should work normally with WebSocket status showing "Offline"
2. **With Socket Server**: WebSocket status should show "Live" and real-time features should work
3. **Connection Loss**: App should gracefully handle disconnections and show appropriate status

The WebSocket errors are now completely resolved and the app provides a robust real-time experience with proper fallbacks.
